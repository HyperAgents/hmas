    He boots the robot that start running the main controler agent. 
    The boot sequence of the robot contains a visual scanning that harvests any QR code visible arround. 
    The Agent gets a handler of its workspace (was: environment) and requests which contains descriptions of its environment including some known entry points. 
    "It discovers the interface to register itself" to the entrypoint and places such a request. 
    The UI agent of Fabio shows the candidate addition to the entry point and he validates the addition. 
    The agent and the robot is now visible to the rest of the factory and vice-versa. 
    The user behind the UI Agent places requests to configure new goals for the agent controler of the robot.
