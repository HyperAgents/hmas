# An informal competency question is a natural language question that represents an informal requirement within a particular domain.
# Usually, in order to address all the requirements of the domain in consideration, a set of more than one competency question is needed.
# In this case, the set must be organised hierarchically: we will have higher-level competency questions that require answers to other much lower-level questions.
