## Glossary

* **Situated Regulated Organization Entity**: Organization situated on Agents and Artifacts, regulated by a normative system. The Agents' actions on Artifacts and Agents' interactions with other Agents of the same entity are regulated by the normative system (i.e., regulative norms resulting from the enactment of abstract regulative norms part of the normative specification of the Organization).

### Recommendations

Schema.org includes the classes [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) and [`schema:OrganizationRole`](https://schema.org/OrganizationRole) but these classes are mostly used for human organizations. They may be considered as sub-classes of the classes defined in the HyperAgents vocabularies.

The [W3C ORG ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) defines ground concepts that may be reused in the HyperAgents regulation vocabulary.
