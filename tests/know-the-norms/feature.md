# Know the Norms

## Short description
Norms and laws are explicitly considered in a hMAS. Thus, one agent needs to understand these norms to know if it is allowed to perform or not an action but also must know the sanctions when they are violated.  In case of violations of norms, sanctions have to be applied.

## Examples
1. [E-Commerce](../../scenarios/e-commerce.md)
2. [Mobility as a Service](../../scenarios/mobility-as-a-service.md)
