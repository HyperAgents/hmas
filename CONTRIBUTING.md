# Contributing

(inspired from https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/ )

(Ideas for the contributing doc : mentioning SAMOD and the dev tools by Maxime ??, How to use the rdfs:seeAlso and rdfs:comments ? e.g. rdfs:seeAlso may help to refer to issues ? and rdfs:comments can be used to give the definition of classes/props and some reflexions e.g. some conclusions of issues? )

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make :
1. by opening an issue before ; (Give a standard name for title ? for classes and properties ? How name it ? Is there any convention ? )
2. discuss the problem with the different contributors ;
3. close the issue when there is a consensus (we make a vote?) and capture the consensus and rationale in the ontology itself;
4. keep a record summarizing the reflections in this file about the modifications that will be applied (section Justifications of ontological choices);
5. do a pull request.
6. (Getting an approval before merging ?)

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at hyperagents@listes.emse.fr. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.


## Good practices

### Using the current classes and properties

1) Use rather hmas:directlyContains and do not use hmas:transitivelyContains (only for requests)

Related issues :
https://github.com/HyperAgents/ns.hyperagents.org/issues/6


2) When should you use rdfs:seeAlso instead of dct:source?

Use dct:source when the described resource is derived from the related resource in whole or in part e.g. a particular comment that justifies the described resource or the motivating scenario.

Use rdfs:seeAlso for every resources that is related to the described resource e.g. the rationale given in issues, similar resources.

3) Use rdfs:comments to give the definition of your described resource

### Creating new classes and properties

1) Do not duplicate the same difference in properties, classes and ranges/domains

We mean by do not duplicating e.g. do not create a class hmas:containsArtifact if hmas:contains is enough since the type of ressource allows you to know the nature of the container.

### Modifying a class or a property




### Deleting a class or a property

1) If a class is not necessary for the ontology and not justified by a motivating scenario, then this class can be delete.

We seek to express our ontology in the most minimalist and simplest way possible. 
We believe that the elegance of a formalism lies in its simplicity and generalization. 
Apply the philosophy of an Occam's razor.

## Justifications of ontological choices

(Question : put this section into comments or in rdfs:comment ?? keep this file generic as a general methodology to contribute on HyperAgent)

[CL: I think this section will be removed ! The rdfs:seeAlso, dct:source will be used to make references to issues.]

### Issue name X OR explanation of using a certain class e.g. "Hostable/NotHostable" ?
(I'm going to give an example of the structuration of this section through an example)

### hmas:platform issues

1) ambiguÃ¯ty of the definition with SSN ?

-> Previous definition : "A platform is a system providing a collection of features to support Hypermedia MAS. Common features include support for communication and interaction, runtime environments for agents, artifacts, or organization, etc "


Current state of the issue : solved

Solution : 
* rename it as :MASPlatform 
* propose a new definition : ""

### hmas:workspace issues

1) hmas:Workspace seems similar to ldp:Container

@Fabien said : LDP has the ldp:Container and the ldp:contains that links a container with resources in the container:
https://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#

Questions could be:

    Is a hmas:Workspace rdfs:subClassOf ldp:Container ?
    if yes should we (re)use ldp:contains ?
    if not what is the difference and relation between them if any ?


Current state of the issue : not solved

Solution : 


### hmas:hosts

1) The range is not clear ?

Reflexions of the range and the domains of hosts in the file :

https://partage.imt.fr/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/536638000?filePath=%2FShared%2FHyperAgents%2FVocabularies%2FDomainsAndRanges.xlsx


2) Do we need classes Hostable and NotHostable to set the range of hmas:hosts?


### hmas:contains 

1) Should we consider hmas:contains as the class ldp:contains ? 



### hmas:hasHomeWorkspace and hmas:hasHomePlatform



### hmas:describes


1) the domain and range of hmas:describes ?

Related issues : 
https://github.com/HyperAgents/ns.hyperagents.org/issues/16


Solution :
* set clear the range as rdfs:ressource


Current state of the issue : solved



### Removed classes : hmas:containsX where X in {Artifact,Agent}

No motivating scenario for hmas:containsX. 
Furthermore users can use hmas:contains on Agent rather than using hmas:containsAgent. 
In issues #X we gave example that show that we do not need hmas:containsX properties since we can directly use hmas:contains
and the type associated to the class gives us the type of entity contained in the workspace.


### hmas:Platform becomes hmas:MASPlatform

### hmas:contains becomes hmas:TransitivelyContains
