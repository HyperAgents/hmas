# Extended Enterprise Domain

## Overview
The Extended Enterprise (EE) domain is illustrated using the example of an eco-system of enterprises working alltogether and forming a supply chain. 

To make it more concrete, let's imagine that one of them is situated in Saint-Etienne (IT'M Factory at MSE), another one is situated in St Gallen at HSG. 

When looking at their agentification on the Web, there are three workspaces (« PW » (Pot production Workspace) situated in HSG, « FW » (Pot filling Workspace) situated in MSE and « TW » (Transport Workspace ensuring the logistic of pot transportation from HSG to MSE). The transporter agents « Transporter » are situated in the «TW». The « HSG » agents are situated in the « PW », the « MSE » agents are situated in the « FW » and  « EE » is situated in the three workspaces. 

The interactions and coordination in the EE (sends a port order, makes an order for pot supply, supply pots) take place in the context of the « EE ».
