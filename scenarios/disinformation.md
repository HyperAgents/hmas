## Deception in MAS [Sakama et al. 2015]

# Motivating scenarios

## Feature : persuading by deceiving an agent to do something

John is feeling back pain, and consequently he is consulting websites that offer medical advice as well as the opportunity to purchase drugs. 

A message from a bot promises, for a fair price, a drug which is said to be an excellent remedy that would eliminate all pain, and can be used for any length of time without producing any dependency. 

This message persuades John to buy the drug and he starts taking it. 

However the bot has deceived John because the bot knows that the drug creates addiction, with serious health consequences. 

John's wife Ann, comes to know that such pills are dangerous. She then removes all pills from the closet. As a consequence John does not take the drug.
