# Create an Organization

## Description
Alice has experience working as a journalist in a reputable news organization, the DPr Network. 
Throughout her career, she has witnessed the growing problem of online disinformation and the negative impact it has on society. 
Motivated to combat these issues on a broader scale, she decides to create her own organization dedicated to tackle online disinformation, the TOD organization. 
Inspired by her experience at DPr Network, Alice intends to use the DPr Network's organization model as reference to organize the TOD organization.

The resource profile of the DPr Network organization is contained in a workspace. To ensure the effectiveness of TOD, she conducts a comparative analysis between DPr Network's organization model

Alice, however, is unsure whether the DPr Network's organization model is adequate in her case. Thus, she conducts a comparative analysis between
DPr Network's organization model and other existing organizations focused on combating disinformation, as well as theoretical organization models proposed by experts in the field.  
She concludes that the DPr Network's organization model provides a solid foundation for the creation of the TOD organization.

The main aspect of the DPr Network that motivated Alice to copy its organization model is the network's culture reflected in its organizational values:
  + _Accountability_: Accompany information evaluations with details about who contributed to the tackling disinformation process, e.g. which agents evaluated the information. 
  + _Transparency_: Accompany information evaluations with details about how one contributed to the tackling disinformation process, e.g. what external services were used to evaluate the information.
 
The TOD organization provides the following roles and responsibilities:
  1. _Active user_: Evaluate online information or consume the aggregated evaluation of prior active users.
  2. _Journalist_: Evaluate online information (a type of active user).
  3. _General evaluator_: Annotate online information based on the general impression of the information (a type of journalist).
  4. _General investigator_: Annotate online information based on the credibility rating of the information, publishers, authors etc. (a type of journalist).
  5. _Image investigator_: Annotate online information based on the original sources of its images (a type of journalist).
  7. _Admin_: Ensure the functionality of the system, e.g. by assigning missions to groups of agents.
  8. _Aggregator_: Annotate online information based on aggregated evaluations to give a summarized overview of the evaluation results (a type of admin).
  9. _Control_: Control the functionality of the system, e.g. by ensuring that community guidelines are met.

Additionally, the TOD organization proposes the following facility that members of the organization can use to achieve organizational goals:
  + _Annotating service_: Agents can interact with the facility to search for the original sources of images and annotate online information with the discovered sources.
