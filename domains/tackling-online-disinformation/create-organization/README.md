# Create an Organization

## Description
Mary has experience working as a journalist in a reputable news organization, the DPr network. 
Throughout her career, she has witnessed the growing problem of online disinformation and the negative impact it has on society. 
Motivated to combat these issues on a broader scale, she decides to create her own organization dedicated to tackle online disinformation, the TOD organization. 
Inspired by her experience at DPr, Mary intends to use the DPr organization model as reference to organize the TOD organization.

The resource profile of the DPr organization is contained in a workspace that operates as a facility of DPr. To ensure the effectiveness of TOD, she conducts a comparative analysis between DPr's organization model

Mary, however, is unsure whether the DPr's organization model is adequate in her case. Thus, she conducts a comparative analysis between
DPr's organization model and other existing organizations focused on combating disinformation, as well as theoretical organization models proposed by experts in the field.  
She concludes that the DPr's organization model provides a solid foundation for the creation of the TOD organization.

The main aspect of the SL Logistics that motivated John to copy its organization model is the enterprise's culture reflected in its organizational values:
  + _Accountability_: Accompany information evaluations with details about who contributed to the tackling disinformation process, e.g. which agents evaluated the information. 
  + _Transparency_: Accompany information evaluations with details about how one contributed to the tackling disinformation process, e.g. what external services were used to evaluate the information.
 
The TOD organization provides the following roles and responsibilities:
  1. _Active user_: Evaluate online information or consume the aggregated evaluation of prior active users.
  2. _Journalist_: Evaluate online information (a type of active user).
  3. _Annotator_: Annotate online information based on the general impression of the information (a type of journalist).
  4. _General investigator_: Annotate online information based on the credibility rating of the information (a type of journalist).
  5. _Image investigator_: Annotate online information based on the original sources of its images (a type of journalist).
  7. _Admin_: Ensure the functionality of the system, e.g. by assigning missions to groups of agents.
  8. _Aggregator_: Annotate online information based on aggregated evaluations to give a summarized overview of the evaluation results (a type of admin).
  9. _Control_: Control the functionality of the system, e.g. by ensuring that community guidelines are met.

Additionally, the TOD organization proposes the following facility that members of the organization can use to achieve organizational goals:
  + _Annotator facility_: Agents can interact with the facility to search for the original sources of images and annotate online information with the discovered sources.
