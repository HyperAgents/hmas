# Join an Organization

## Description
Alice had decided to use the News Network organizational model to enact the TOD organization. In this case, the enactment of the TOD organization has been reflected in the hypermedia environment with the creation of an organization board artifact that can be used to enter and manage the organization. The organization board artifact is a material of the TOD organization, and it is contained in the News Network workspace. 

While situated in the same workspace, Carol notices the organization board artifact and decides to enter the TOD organization to contribute in tackling online disinformation. Upon examining the artifact's profile, Carol perceives information about how to execute an action to enact a membership, and therefore, to become an active user in the organization's group of active users. As the TOD organization maintains an open and inclusive approach, Carol is able to directly enact the membership without having to undergo a specific application process, despite it being her first interaction with the organization.

Being now a member of the TOD organization, Carol decides to evaluate the content of an article that she read on the Web, and, therefore, to enact an article evaluation group so that she can contribute her evaluation along with other members of the organization. For this, she interacts with the organization board artifact to enact such a group based on information that she discovers on the artifact's profile. The enactment of the article evaluation group is reflected in the hypermedia environment with the creation of a group board artifact, that is a material of the TOD organization, is contained in the News Network workspace, and can be used to manage the new group.

Agents that enact memberships in the new article evaluation group can contribute to the evaluation of an article. Associated to this group, the TOD organization defines the following set of positions:
+ _Article General Evaluator_: Annotate the article based on the article's general impression.
+ _Article General Investigator_: Annotate the article based on the article's credibility rating, publishers, authors etc.
+ _Article Media Investigator_: Annotate the article based on the original sources of its images.
+ _Article Aggrecator_: Annotate the article based on aggregated evaluations to give a summarized overview of the evaluation results

Upon examining the group board artifact's profile, Carol perceives information about how to execute an action to enact a memebership in the new group, and therefore take over one of the positions. Carol enacts the article general evaluator membership to become a general evaluator in the new article evaluation group.
