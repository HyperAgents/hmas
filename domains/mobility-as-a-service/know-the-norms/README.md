## Description

Example of countries law and sanctions are:
* Law No person shall drive a vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property. The maximum speed are:
  + 130 km/h in highways
  + 110 km/h in a one-way road separated by a central empty area
  + 80 km/h in other roads
