# Create an Organization

## Description
John has experience working in a successful specialized industrial logistics enterprise, the SL Logistics. He sees a business opportunity in providing the same logistics services and wants to create his own enterprise, the FL Logistics. Because of his own experience and the success of the SL Logistics, John intends to use the SL Logistics organization model as reference to organize the FL Logistics.

John, however, is unsure whether the SL Logistics' organizational model is adequate in his case. Thus, he conducts a comparative analysis between the SL Logistics organizational model with similar enterprises but whose organizational model are based on different assumptions and some theoretical models (i.e., not yet enacted models). He concludes that the SL Logistics' organizational model is adequate to create the FL Logistics enterprise.

The main aspect of the SL Logistics that motivated John to copy its organizational model is the enterprise culture reflected in its organizational values:

* **Organizational Values**
  + _Commitment_: Do everything you can to keep the organization promisses to the customers.
  + _Integrity and Respect_: Communicate openly and honestly with the customers and other members of the organization.

Additionally, the FL Logistics will mirror the composition of the SL Logistics and provides the following roles and responsibilities:
  1. _Human resources officer_: Hire, develop and look after employees.
  2. _Finance officer_: Ensure payable invoices are processed and payed, and receivable invoices payments are received.
