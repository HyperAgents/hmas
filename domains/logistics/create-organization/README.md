# Create an Organization

## Description
John has experience working in a successful specialized industrial logistics enterprise in Switzerland, the SL Logistics. He sees a business opportunity in providing the same service in France. Because of his own experience and the success of the SL Logistics, John decides to use the SL Logistics as a model to organize his own enterprise, the FL Logistics.

John, however, is unsure whether the company is viable and that business and organizational model are adequate for France. Thus, he produces a comparative analysis among the SL Logistics, other similar enterprises in France but whose business and organizational models are based on different assumptions, and other theoretical models (i.e., not yet enacted models). He concludes that the SL Logistics is viable and adequate for France, yet he will need to increase the number of warehouses due to the covered area in France.

The main aspect of the SL Logistics that motivated John to copy the SL Logistics business and organizational model is the company culture reflected in their organizational values and goals:

* **Organizational Values**
  + _Commitment_: Do everything you can to keep the organization promisses to the customers.
  + _Integrity and Respect_: Communicate openly and honestly with the customers and other members of the organization.
* **Organization Goals**
  + _Enhanced Customer Service_: Better handling of transportation and the overall logistics operation.
  + _Enhanced Efficiency_: Increase the cost-effectiviness of the transportation system, reduce overhead costs and simplify the order processing.

Besides, the FL Logistics mirrors the composition of the SL Logistics and provides the following roles and responsibilities:
  1. _Human resources officer_: Hire, develop and look after employees.
  2. _Finance officer_: Ensure payable invoices are processed and payed, and receivable invoices payments are received.
  3. _Account manager_: Build and maintain a relationship with customers. Prospect and sell logistic services to industrial enterprises in France.
  4. _Planner_: Plan the optimized delivery schedule according to the customers' requirements and constraints.
  5. _Transporter_: Transport goods between customers and logistics warehouses, or vice-versa.
  6. _Collector_: Collect goods in customers or logistics warehouses according to the plan elaborated by the _Planner_.
  7. _Deliverer_: Deliver goods to customers or logistics warehouses according to the plan elaborated by the _Planner_.
  
The FL Logistics has several warehouses distributed all over France to facilitate and streamline the collect and delivery of goods.
