# Create an Organization

## Description
John has experience in working in a successful specialized industrial logistics enterprise in Switzerland, the SL Logistics. He sees a business opportunity in providing the same service in France and creates the FL Logistics. Because of his own experience and the success of the SL Logistics, John decides to use the SL Logistics as a model to organize the FL Logistics.

Mirroring the SL Logistics, the FL Logistics is structured in five departments:
  1. Human Resources (HR) : Define the role of _human resources officer_ who is responsible for hiring, developing and looking after employees.
  2. Financial : Define the role of _finance officer_ who is responsible for all financial aspects of the organization ensuring payable invoices are processed and payed, and receivable invoices payments are received.
  3. Commercial : Define the role of _account manager_ who is responsible for building and maintaining a relationship with clients. They prospect and sale the logistic services to industrial enterprises in France.
  4. Planning : Define the role of _planner_ who is responsible for planning the optimized delivery schedule according to the customers' requirements and constraints.
  5. Delivery : Define the role of _deliverer_ who is responsible for collecting and delivering the goods in different facilities and storage locations according to the plan elaborated by the _planner_.

These roles can be played by human or artificial agents. The roles defined by the HR, Financial, and Commercial departments are played by human agents since they require interaction with other humanns (e.g., customers) and demand more negotiation and creativity skills. The roles defined by the Planning and Delivery departments are played by artificial agents, respectively strictly one planning system and one or multiple autonomous delivery trucks.
