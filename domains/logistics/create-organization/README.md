# Create an Organization

## Description
John has experience working in a successful specialized industrial logistics enterprise, the SL Logistics. He sees a business opportunity in providing the same logistics services and wants to create his own enterprise, the FL Logistics. Because of his own experience and the success of the SL Logistics, John intends to use the SL Logistics organization model as reference to organize the FL Logistics.

The FL Logistics enterprise is represented as an organization in the hypermedia environment. Its resource profile is contained in a workspace.

John, however, is unsure whether the SL Logistics' organization model is adequate in his case. Thus, he conducts a comparative analysis between the SL Logistics organization model with other existing organizations with similar organization model as well as with theoretical organization models. He concludes that the SL Logistics' organization model is adequate to create the FL Logistics organization.

The main aspect of the SL Logistics that motivated John to copy its organization model is the enterprise's culture reflected in its organizational values:

* **Organizational Values**
  + _Commitment_: Do everything you can to keep the organization promises to the customers.
  + _Integrity and Respect_: Communicate openly and honestly with the customers and other members of the organization.

The FL Logistics mirrors the composition of the SL Logistics and provides the following roles and responsibilities:
  1. _Human resources officer_: Hire, develop and look after employees.
  2. _Finance officer_: Ensure payable invoices are processed and payed, and receivable invoices payments are received.
  3. _Account manager_: Build and maintain a relationship with customers. Prospect and sell logistic services to industrial enterprises in France.
  4. _Planner_: Plan the optimized delivery schedule according to the customers' requirements and constraints.
  5. _Carrier_: Carry goods between customers and logistics warehouses, or vice-versa.
  6. _Collector_: Collect goods in customers or logistics warehouses according to the plan elaborated by the _Planner_.
  7. _Deliverer_: Deliver goods to customers or logistics warehouses according to the plan elaborated by the _Planner_.
  
The FL Logistics also mirrors the functions of the spacial layout by defining a picking and receiving areas.
