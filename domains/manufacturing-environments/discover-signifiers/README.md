# Discover Signifiers

Feature: Discovery of Signifiers


## Description
An agent is situated in a manufacturing workspace that contains  industrial artifacts, e.g. industrial devices. The agent discovers signifiers in the workspace, that reveal information about the affordances offered to the agent by the industrial artifacts. 

The agent may search for all the signifiers in the manufacturing workspace, or for all the signifiers exposed in a specific artifact profile, such as the profile of a robotic arm. (The related affordances may be currently exploitable by the agent or not).

## Competency Questions

| ID | Question in Natural Language | Example |
|----|------------------------------|---------|
| q1 | What are the signifiers with a given IRI?                            | |
| q2 | What are the signifiers exposed in the profile of a given artifact?  | |
| q3 | What are the signifiers available in a given workspace?              | |

## Glossary
-	Signifier: A perceivable sign/cue that can be interpreted meaningfully to reveal information about affordances, e.g. about relational aspects of affordances based on environment/agent types and context that are expected in the Hypermedia MAS. The perceptability of a signifier can be managed by adjusting the salience of the signifier.
-	IsExposedIn: A relation between a signifier and a resource profile it is exposed in.
-	ResourceProfile: see [_Other scenario TBA_]().
-	Artifact: see [_Other scenario TBA_]().
-	Workspace: see [_Other scenario TBA_]().
