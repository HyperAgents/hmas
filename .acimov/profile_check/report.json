The term :Signifier is selected instead for the following reasons: 1) Affordances emerge upon the presence of individual agents in the appropriate situation, while signifiers are defined with respect to agent types to preserve the evolvability and reusability of interaction cues without requiring prior knowledge about individual agents; 2) Affordances are defined in [Chemero and Turvey, 2007] for studying interactions of animals, while signifiers are defined here for supporting interactions of autonomous agents, which exhibit more heterogeneous abilities than animals \u2014 including agents whose cognitive abilities exclusively rely on computational processes such as reasoning over representations. Here, the concept is provided to support the discussion, management, and modelling of signifiers, which reveal information about affordances [Norman, 2013]. For example, the association between the two terms enables examining the dynamic exposure of signifiers based on the run-time availability of agent abilities and situations, or the modelling of signifiers that reveal information about affordances for both artificial and human agents.\"@en ;\r\n  skos:historyNote \"The definition of the concept follows affordance theorists [Chemero and Turvey, 2007].\"@en ;\r\n  skos:prefLabel \"affordance\"@en ;\r\n  skos:related <https://purl.org/hmas/Signifier>\r\n\r\n4.
